    APBS uses PMG and FEtk to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
    numerically.  FEtk and PMG are developed and maintained by the Holst
    Research Group at UC San Diego.  PMG is designed to solve the nonlinear
    Poisson-Boltzmann equation and similar problems with linear space and
    time complexity through the use of box methods, inexact Newton methods,
    and algebraic multilevel methods.  FEtk is designed to solve general
    coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations accurately
    and efficiently using adaptive multilevel finite element methods,
    inexact Newton methods, and algebraic multilevel methods.  More
    information about PMG and FEtk may be found at <http://www.FEtk.ORG>.
